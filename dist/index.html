      <h1>What is a Linear SVM222?</h1>
      <p>The idea behind maximum margin classifers are to implement linear separability to correctly classify data into categories.<br>
        Support Vector Machines are a form of margin margin classifers that aim to have large margins between the decision boundary and training point.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For SVMs, a support vector is a training point such that \(y_i \vec{w} \cdot \text{Aug}(\vec{x}^{(i)}) = 1\)<br>
        Solutions for Hard-SVMs aim to have perfect classification with no slack; therefore, the solution for the problem becomes \(\vec{w}^\star\ = \sum_{i \in S} y_i a_i \text{Aug}(\vec{x}^{(i)})\)</p>
      <p>Alternatively, we the soft-SVM problem allows for some classifications to be wrong with distance \(\epsilon_i \)<br>
        The problem becomes: \(\min_{\vec(w) \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}, \vec{\epsilon} \in \mathbb{R}^n} \lVert{\vec{w}}\rVert^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \)<br>
        Where, \(C\) is considered the slack parameter: Large \(C\) avoids misclassifications with low slack and Small \(C\) allows for more slack at the cost of misclassifications.
      </p>
      <p>This interactive visualization recreates allow for experimentation for how linear boundaries work in SVMs. By adjusting the \(\vec{w}\) parameters, you can see how the boundary shifts along with the support vectors.</p>

      <p> Writeup:</p>
      <p>1. What have you done so far?
        We created an interactive graph that shows Pitch Pair. The graph shows the Release Spin Rate and Release Speed for each picth pair.
        The interactivity of the graph includes changing the pair by using the drop down bar. Moreover, once the user hovers on the dots,
        it would show what pitch type it is indicating. We also create a little writeup that explains what SVMs is and what we are trying to 
        show with this visualization. </p>

      <p>2. What will be the most challenging part of your project to design and why?
        The most challenging part of our project would be draw a line between the data. This would be the hardest part of the project because we have
        to make sure that it is accurate. Additionally, we have to move the line based on the w0, w1, w2. This will be hard since
        the user can change those values based on the slides so it might be hard to calculate an accurate line.
